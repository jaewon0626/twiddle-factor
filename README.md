# twiddle-factor.m
Through the matlab, the values of 512 rotation factors according to the angle are obtained as real and imaginary parts, respectively.

# twiddle_factor_bin.py 
After that, the values obtained are exported to a csv file and converted into a txt file through Python.
The rotational factor values converted into txt files are binarized and stored.

# bin_real.py
real_to_bin

# bin_imag.py
imag_to_bin
